# Front-End Development Assignment 2 - eCommerce Online Platform (MokeSell)

## About the Project

Our project is to create an online eCommerce platform called "MokeSell" that allows users to buy and sell new and second-hand products.

The features we plan to implement are:
- Account creation and login feature that allows users to create an account and log into the platform.
- Create listings feature that allows users to create listing by selecting which category their product is in, upload prodcut photos, providing product details.
- Detailed listing viewing enabled by dynamic product pages and usage of database and APIs.
- Search and like feature, allowing buyers to search for specific items using keywords, and allowing buyers to save listings by liking them.
- Chat Feature, where buyers can start a chat with sellers to discuss transaction details, right from the detailed listing page.


## APIs
- Made the account signup/login feature working using supabase api to create a database to store and fetch user's name, email and password.
- Made the listings displayed in the products, sorted by their respective categories. Each listing's individual details are displayed dynamically using one product.html page, fetched from the database listings table when called.
- Made the chat function allowing users to communicate in real time with sellers / other users.
